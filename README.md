# Floating Ideas repository

The Floating Ideas website is built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


This site uses the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). The repository was forked from the [template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) repository. Feel free to use this site or that one as a starting point for you own blog.
